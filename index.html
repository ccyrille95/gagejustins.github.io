	<h2>Justin Gage, Mediocre Data Scientist</h2>
	<p>I'm a (mediocre) Data Scientist with a focus on integrating data into general functions (like growth and product). I work at <a href="https://algorithmia.com">Algorithmia</a>, a startup that deploys Machine Learning at scale.</p> 
	<p>I used to be a VC Analyst, majored in Data Science at <a href="http://www.stern.nyu.edu/portal-partners/current-students/undergraduate/academics/degree-programs/business-program/computing-and-data-science">NYU Stern</a>, and really like listening to and playing music.</p>
