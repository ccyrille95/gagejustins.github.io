	<h1>Justin Gage, Data (Scientist)</h1>
	<p>I'm a Data Scientist (the easiest way to call yourself a scientist these days) with a focus on integrating data into general functions, like growth and product). I work at <a href="https://algorithmia.com" style="color: #5000BE;" target="_blank">Algorithmia</a>, a startup that deploys Machine Learning at scale.</p> 
	<p>I used to be a VC Analyst, majored in Data Science at <a href="http://www.stern.nyu.edu/portal-partners/current-students/undergraduate/academics/degree-programs/business-program/computing-and-data-science" style="color: #57068C;" target="_blank">NYU Stern</a>, and really like listening to / playing music (specifically blues).</p>
