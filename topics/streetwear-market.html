It’s difficult to analyze without participating.</p>
				<p>This is my first yearly attempt at a full scale market analysis: we’re going to look at who the major players are, why I think Grailed is best positioned to win, and how the increasing availability of previously scarce items will impact the landscape.

				<p>Streetwear is an aesthetic – or a style of dress – that incorporates unique, scarce, and obscure items into an outfit. The definition is fluid and constantly evolving, but here’s what a typical streetwear outfit might look like.</p>

				<p>The streetwear aesthetic relies on pieces, or “grails” as they’re called in the community: outfits are built modularly from sneakers, jeans, shirts, etc. that have their own personality or calling. Here are a few classic streetwear pieces:</p>
				<ul>

			<div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1">
				<p>Streetwear is heavily community-driven, and this differentiates it from other areas of fashion. One of the major <i>reasons</i> why people invest in streetwear is to connect with others who care about it – walking by someone on the street wearing a similarly obscure outfit often creates a cool level of mutual understanding. The streetwear world thrives on details, limited information, and scarcity (more on that later) – all which lend themselves to small groups and insider culture.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1">
				<p>Streetwear is a segment of the fashion market that operates on wartime supply and demand curves. In normal fashion (as with most other lightly regulated markets), manufacturing operates on a supply and demand basis: if clothing sells well, more will be manufactured. Accordingly, there is no aftermarket: what you want will be available at retailers, and you’ll buy it from them.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row text-center">
			<div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1 top-padding-md bottom-margin-sm">

				<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 1em;">Figure 1: How streetwear brands play with the supply and demand curves</p>
			</div>
		</div>	
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1">
				<p>Streetwear turns that model on its head by <i>fixing supply and ignoring demand</i>. Streetwear relies on a relatively old concept in fashion – manufactured scarcity – to drive hype and create an aftermarket. Essentially, despite the fact that there’s demonstrated demand for a particular item or brand, manufacturers and labels will not increase supply to match it. Pretty weird, right?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Normal brands: you want to buy my stuff? I’ll make more of it!</li>
					<li>Streetwear: you want to buy my stuff? Good luck!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>It makes a lot of sense if you understand it as a marketing strategy instead of a sales one. By successfully manufacturing scarcity (more on this below), brands can build suspense and future demand. This isn’t a new idea: it exists in luxury brand strategy like at Ferrari, the early days of iPhone, and (remarkably) with Canada Goose sizing. Brands effectively sacrifice meeting <i>current demand</i> with an eye on growing <i>future demand</i> and building a brand.</p>

				<h2 class="supreme">How manufactured scarcity works</h2>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1">
				<p>Manufacturing scarcity isn’t as simple as just not making something. Properly executed scarcity relies on 3 core tenets:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>All of your stock at retailers sells out quickly</li>
					<li>There’s a robust aftermarket for your stock on multiple platforms</li>
					<li>Prices on aftermarket platforms are significantly higher than retail</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Not all items and releases will follow this playbook (some will be unsuccessful), but brands must execute on each of these to successfully manufacture scarcity. For a great example, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/05/using-bots-to-buy-supreme-limited-edition-streetwear/" target="_blank">let’s take a look at Supreme</a> – the granddaddy of scarcity – and how they’ve built a brand on top of people not being able to buy their stuff.</p>
				<p>Supreme is a streetwear brand that makes random stuff: t-shirts, bricks, boxes, a thermos, a hand-axe, and other assorted items. Here’s how it works:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Supreme releases a season line in drops or sales windows: each season’s line is released at a set time</li>
					<li>Items usually sell out immediately (like the within-10-minutes-kind of immediately)</li>
					<li>Buyers looking to <i>flip</i> their items list them on aftermarket platforms for multiples of the retail price</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1">
				<p>Supreme is its own brand, but bigger apparel manufacturers have also made their stake in this market. Adidas and Nike have both had their share of streetwear success in the past few years (and decades) – Adidas with their Yeezy and Pharrell lines, and Nike with Jordans, SBs, and the recent Virgil Abloh collab. Here’s how these drops work:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Adidas and Nike have mobile apps (Adidas’s used to be called Confirmed, and Nike’s is called SNKRS)</li>
					<li>“Drops” are scheduled in advance for streetwear that Adidas / Nike anticipate will be viral</li>
					<li>Mobile apps alert users when “drops” are happening (either in advance or ad hoc)</li>
					<li>Supply is so scarce that the apps carry out raffles to determine who gets to buy the drop (you read that right: the raffle is for the chance to buy <i>something</i>)</li>
				</ul>

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1">
				<p>Adidas and Nike have the resources to create their own apps, but not all drops happen this way. Supreme has its own site for drops, and other players make use of physical retail as well. Most Adidas and Nike drops also incorporate their stores as well as resellers.</p>
				<p>Drops are a culture in of themselves. The experience of waiting to see if you’ve won a drop is unique, and the line you wait on at the Nike store to pick up your prize is a community. People in the know what you’re there for, and the mutual respect can be intoxicating.</p>

			<div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1">
				<p>One of the bittersweet parts of “big streetwear” – or when bigger apparel brands have successful streetwear releases – is how they leverage those hits into market share. Unlike indie brands like Supreme that live and die by scarcity, Adidas and Nike are large brands: selling a single line of shoes, even above retail, doesn’t move the bottom line. Instead, they turn their streetwear into normwear. Here’s their playbook:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Build a successful line of streetwear products</li>
					<li>Pick one stylistic or material element of a successful streetwear product</li>
					<li>Create a new mass market item that incorporates that element</li>
					<li>Profit</li>

		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1">
				<p>Adidas and Nike have done this again and again, and it works. Adidas pioneered their Boost technology with their Yeezy line (a Kanye West collaboration), and it ended up becoming a staple of most of their new models. They also created the Deerupt Runner, which has a very similar silhouette to Yeezys. Nike recently had a bunch of success with their React Element 87: so they copied the sole and upper shape into a mass market shoe that’s half the price.</p>
				<p>Market demand creates beautiful art, and then consequently destroys it through mass market copies.</p>

				<h1 class="topics_header">The aftermarket landscape in streetwear</h1> 
				<p>The most important part of the streetwear market is the aftermarket: it’s what really determines how scarce something is and how much respect you’ll garner among the community for owning it. There are 4 major players in the streetwear aftermarket: Grailed, GOAT, StockX, and StadiumGoods. Their platforms allow people to sell their streetwear to the highest bidder, and usually take a commission for bringing supply and demand together.</p>
				<p>When evaluating these platforms against one another, there are 4 essential elements that separate the user experience from competitors.</p>

				<p>The biggest market inefficiency in streetwear is fraud: whenever things sell for a lot, counterfeit will always be an issue. When buying on an aftermarket platform, you will likely not return if you buy something that turns out to be fake, even if you end up getting your money back. There are three broad methodologies for attacking this problem:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Company check: sellers must send items to a central location for their authenticity to be verified, and then the items can be send to buyers</li>
					<li>Community check: a ratings based system and strong banning policy can naturally discourage sellers from committing fraud</li>
					<li>Automatic check: a well designed Machine Learning system can detect fraud using pictures, language, and seller history (note: this has not been commercially implemented yet)</li>

				<p>Grailed is very different from the other platforms on this map: it’s a real marketplace:</p>
				<p style="font-style: italic;">Items are listed as listings, all individual from each other.</p>

					<li>On the other platforms, there’s an SKU-based hierarchy, meaning that <i>items</i> are sold. On StockX and StadiumGoods, for example, you don’t really know who you’re buying from. You're getting an abstracted item.</li>
				</ul>
				<p style="font-style: italic;">The buying and selling process is iterative and heavy on bargaining.</p>

				<p>Let’s put some numbers on the board. According to Bain & Co., personal luxury goods sales increased by 5% in 2017 to $309B worldwide. Their report says that 85% of last year’s growth was driven by Generations Y and Z, and “t-shirts, down jackets and sneakers were among the standout categories in 2017, growing by 25%, 15% and 10%, respectively.” There’s not much specificity around what types of streetwear are involved here, since lines can be so blurred and subjective.</p>
				<p>That being said, growth of the streetwear market itself is only part of the equation: aftermarket platforms are tapping into a more nuanced segment of the industry. They fill 4 core needs that retailers can’t:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Buying and selling <i>used</i> sneakers and streetwear</li>
					<li>Buying and selling scarce items that are sold out at retail (manufactured scarcity)</li>
					<li>Buying and selling non-scarce items that retailed years ago (natural scarcity)</li>
					<li>Community, content, and general “insider” culture</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The core insight here is that aftermarket platforms can make money – and indeed do make money – without any new goods being produced. Essentially, with the right strategy, they can create brand new markets by encouraging consumers to buy, sell, and trade with each other. That’s why their success is <i>tied</i> to macro numbers for luxury goods growth, but not <i>limited</i> to it.</p>
				<p>Ultimately, for investors, the market question around these platforms is tied both to macro trends (streetwear growth) as well as the ability of these platforms to create their own submarkets.</p>

				<p>An important insight in studying complex systems is that some relationships don’t scale, and the same might be true for streetwear. As streetwear grows in popularity, it paradoxically will lose much of the allure that it garners with insiders. Above, we covered the personal and insular element of the streetwear community: part of the fun is that it’s unique, can look kinda weird, and makes other people confused. The more mainstream streetwear becomes, the less those benefits apply.</p>
				<p>To understand this trend more deeply, it’s helpful to segment the users of these aftermarket platforms into a few groups:</p>

				<p>I suspect that sales on aftermarket platforms are heavily driven by the “Hypebeast” persona: these are people who are experts in streetwear, know exactly what they want, and are extremely savvy on price. As streetwear expands in popularity, this is the group that becomes marginalized and is at risk of leaving / getting into another trend. They also buy the highest price stuff, which translates to higher average revenue for marketplaces (commission based).</p>
				<p>For a concrete example of what this means, consider Adidas’s collaboration series with Kanye West: Yeezy. Typically, Yeezys are dropped every few months and are wildly popular: they almost always sell for more than 2x retail on the platforms in question. That has been the case for years, but the landscape has been rapidly changing over the past few months: Yeezys have been becoming more available.</p>
				<p>The last two Yeezy drops – the 350v2 Butter and the 500 Utility Black – were dropped in such great quantities that they’re barely selling for more than retail now. Aside from the Yeezy Powerphase (which was generally considered a failure), that’s totally unique in Yeezy history. This is not a fluke: Kanye has publicly expressed his desire to get Yeezys into the hands of whoever wants them, and indicated that the Cream drop on September 21st will be the largest ever.</p>

				<p>If streetwear staples like Yeezys are readily available for prices similar to retail, what does that mean for aftermarket platforms? Going back to the 4 core benefits of aftermarket platforms:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Buying and selling used clothing – no change</li>
					<li><strike>Buying and selling scarce items that are sold out at retail (manufactured scarcity)</strike> – timeline gets pushed out, demand plummets </li>
					<li>Buying and selling non-scarce items that retailed years ago (natural scarcity) – no change</li>
					<li><strike>Community, content, and general “insider” culture</strike> – insider culture gains major importance as streetwear becomes mainstream</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As streetwear and streetwear culture becomes more mainstream, it begins to erode the value proposition of aftermarket platforms for certain user personas. Growth will mean moving</p>

				<p>Overall, I don’t see any of these platforms as best positioned right now. StockX and Stadium Goods are ideal for buyers who know exactly what they want and don’t want to bargain.

				<p>Aftermarket platforms effectively have two options to weather the incoming storm that is streetwear ubiquity:</p>

					<li>Become a quasi-retailer, beef up your UX, and cater to new users</li>
					<li>Focus on alternative markets (used, super high-end)</li>

			<div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1">
				<p>GOAT, StockX, and Stadium Goods seem to be focused on the former: creating a more retail-like experience within an actual marketplace. They seek to effectively commoditize supply and abstract it to “just sneakers” or “just clothing” – regardless of where it came from. Grailed, on the other hand, seems to be taking another approach: and I think they’re positioning themselves best.</p>
				<p>As a retail-like player, there’s one giant problem that these companies will face: validation and fraud measures don’t scale. As the process currently stands, here’s how it works (for GOAT, StockX, and StadiumGoods):</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Item is listed and sold</li>
					<li>Seller ships item to company warehouse</li>
					<li>Company independently verifies authenticity</li>
					<li>Company ships item to buyer</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This (tedious) process avoids fraud, but is a major setback for both buyer UX (shipping necessarily takes a long time) and profitability. As their volume grows, these companies need to keep hiring employees to verify merchandise. Ultimately, these platforms will need to find a way to shorten shipping time, improve the verification process, or hope that a superior UX will outweigh the downsides of manual verification.</p>

				<p>Grailed, on the other hand, has sellers ship directly to buyers and relies on communities and moderators for verification. We can assume that they have higher fraud rates, but their overhead as a company is much lower. This process is much more scalable in theory.</p>
				<p>But the major difference between Grailed and the other platforms we’ve covered – and the reason why I think they’re best positioned to be successful – is that they <i>haven’t</i> started making the shift towards providing a more retail-like experience. Buying and selling on Grailed is still a highly manual, iterative, bargaining-heavy process. It’s clear that they’re doubling down on being the place for (a) community, and (b) used stuff.</p>

						<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 1em; padding-top: 45px;">Grailed selling is iterative (note the transparent price changes)</i></p>
					</div>
				</div>	
				<p>I have no doubt that GOAT, StockX, and StadiumGoods can grow into large retailers: the question is only what their margins will look like, and whether that’s really a business that they want to be in. Grailed seems to be positioning itself to stick firmly in the marketplace arena and building features around making that better. They’ve shown no initiative towards commoditizing supply.</p>
				<p>The question for Grailed is complex: can they improve the UX of both buying and selling without compromising their insider status, marketplace feel, and dominance in used stuff? Here are few features that might help them do that (surprise: many are Machine Learning based):</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Create a better inventory system by using Machine Learning to cluster listings into set SKUs</li>
					<li>Show previous sale prices alongside listings</li>
					<li>Predict eventual sale price with Machine Learning, and show that to the seller when listing</li>
					<li>Improve fraud detection with more stringent picture upload requirements along with Machine Learning for fraud classification</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If Grailed can execute on some of these new features, they’ll move closer towards being an independent marketplace with a great UX for both buyers and sellers: and that’s what ultimately will win this market. In summary, here’s why I think Grailed is strongly positioned:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Strongest community around has the best chance of weathering the growth in streetwear popularity</li>
					<li>Scalable verification process has weak spots, but can be meaningfully improved</li>
					<li>Widest catalog (including used stuff) keeps Grailed well positioned relative to retailers</li>
				</ol>
				<p>That being said, the impacts of streetwear becoming mainstream are fairly unpredictable. I’ve attempted to explain what I think it means for the market, but it’s anyone’s guess.</p>
