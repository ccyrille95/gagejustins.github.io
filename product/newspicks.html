		<section>
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 180px;">NewsPicks is <span style="color: red;">already a great app</span> – 4.6 stars and 2K reviews on the App Store – and I have <span style="color: red;">a few ideas</span> to take it to the next level.</h3>

		<section>
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">First project: basic <span style="color: red;">UX Cleanup</span></h3>
			<p>Nothing crazy here, just some more spacing, cleaner UI, and basic grammar edits.</p>

		<!-- slide 3 -->
		<section>
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Feature build: creating compelling <span style="color: red;">NewsPicks Recommendations</span>.</h3>
			<p>Good recommendations can improve retention and engagement while avoiding the "filter bubble" problem.</p>
			<img src="/assets/images/product/slides/newspicks/recs.png" width="60%" style="min-width: 300px;">
			<p>We can help users find content they might like (not necessarily agree with) based on their positive and negative picks, as well as the picks of their favorite pickers.</p>
		</section>
		<!-- end slide 3 -->

		<!-- slide 4 -->
		<section>
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 100px;">Big product build: something new called <span style="color: red;">"NewsPicks Discussions"</span></h3>
			<p>One of the goals of NewsPicks is to encourage healthy discussion and debate around important topics. Here's what that would look like:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A platform (i.e. high total value) for people to argue about and discuss news</li>
				<li>A system to encourage positivity and discourage and remove "toxic" comments</li>
				<li>Seamless integration with chat to encourage personal connection</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Most of the work will be properly designing incentives and UX to make sure debate is productive.</p>

		<!-- slide 5 -->
		<section>
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 60px;">Big product build: the <span style="color: red;">NewsPicks API</span></h3>
			<p>NewsPicks is uniquely positioned (both data and product-wise) to create an authoritative API for detecting fake news, provided as a service to publishers and platforms.</p>
			<img src="/assets/images/product/slides/newspicks/newspicks_api.png" width="70%" style="min-width: 300px;">
			<p>The NewsPicks API helps expand reach: encouraging healthy debate on other platforms too.</p>
