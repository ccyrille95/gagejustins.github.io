		<section id="1">
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 180px;">Why I'm excited about <span style="color: red;">Product Management</span>.</h3>
			<p>Stories are much more useful (and relevant to product!) than cover letters or resumes.</p>

			<h5 style="margin-bottom: 65px;">My background is all over the place: <span style="color: red;">Data Science major</span>, <span style="color: red;">writing hobby</span>, <span style="color: red;">business school</span>…what am I supposed to do with all of that?</h5>

		<!-- slide 3 -->
		<section>
			<h5 style="margin-bottom: 35px;">I tried business (VC), writing, and Data Science for a bit: but things didn’t click until I <span style="color: red;">started PMing in Growth</span> at Algorithmia.</h5>
			<img src="/assets/images/product/slides/general/onboarding.png" width="30%" style="margin-bottom: 20px; min-width: 300px;">
			<p>The first feature my team shipped was a new onboarding process, and I got to manage the whole thing: start documents and specs, getting sketches ready, working with engineers: it was awesome, and we did a solid job.</p>
		</section>
		<!-- end slide 3 -->

		<!-- slide 4 -->
		<section>
			<h5 style="margin-bottom: 65px;">I think that product breaks down into <span style="color: red;">three major categories</span>, with <span style="color: red;">three unifying principles</span>. A great product manager understands them all.</h5>

		<!-- end slide 4 -->

		<!-- slide 5 -->
		<section>
			<h5 style="margin-bottom: 35px;">I’m a <span style="color: red;">Data Scientist by training</span>, but I make sure to respect the distance and autonomy that engineering needs.</h5>
			<img src="/assets/images/product/slides/general/data.png" width="25%" style="margin-bottom: 20px; min-width: 70px;">
			<p>My Data Science background helps me think through problems in terms of data, and properly run and design product experiments. It also helps me develop meaningful empathy with engineers, which is a key part of being a great PM.</p>

		<!-- slide 6 -->
		<section>
			<h5 style="margin-bottom: 35px;">I’m a <span style="color: red;">self taught designer</span> (Sketch FTW!): I'm not perfect at it, but it gives me an eye to <span style="color: red;">help designers</span>. A couple of mine:</h5>

		<!-- slide 7 -->
		<section>
			<h5 style="margin-bottom: 65px;">I’m a frequent <span style="color: red;">writer and communicator</span> (both professionally and personally), and I think that’s a key part of being a great PM.</h5>
			<img src="/assets/images/product/slides/general/comms.png" width="25%" style="margin-bottom: 40px; min-width: 70px;">
			<p>I write A LOT (like too much) – for work, for pleasure, personally, in data explorations, you name it. Writing great documents and emails helps communicate and avoid mishaps down the road. It’s part of being a great people person, which is part of being a great PM.</p>

		<!-- slide 8 -->
		<section>
			<h5 style="margin-bottom: 80px;">All of these <span style="color: red;">random elements come together</span> in product roles, and I’m excited for a new one.</h5>
			<p>All of the parts of my weird background ended up helping my team ship a great onboarding process: <span style="color: red;">writing</span> great specs, <span style="color: red;">designing</span> great mockups, <span style="color: red;">communicating with and understanding</span> engineering, and analyzing results with <span style="color: red;">Data Scientists</span>.</p>
